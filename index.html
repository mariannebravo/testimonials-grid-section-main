                      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                      The next 12 weeks was the best - and must grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                      course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR Startup."

                  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I wa encouraged to enroll by a
                  former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on, and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                  to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                  during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                  as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!."
